## Adding a project to the gallery

Submit an issue to this repo to get started.

## Maintainers

Adding a project:

- New `project-name.md` goes in the `projects` directory.
- Supporting files &mdash; images, JavaScript &mdash; go in the `static/projects` directory.
- Images in Markdown files must be referenced by their full path (`/projects/my-project/my-image.jpg`).
- Links must be absolute, not relative (e.g. you should use `https://github.com/Novartis/peax` instead of `/Novartis/peax`).
- Supporting files should be kept to a minimum. Demos are suitable for the gallery site. Extensive documentation should be hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of the associated repository instead.
