This is important in cases where accurate quantification on pixel values is necessary. Due to this need, however, these image files (and their corresponding memory footprints) are often large, sometimes approaching 10s (or more) of gigabytes in extreme examples. While memory-mapping these files to access them without loading everything into memory is often a viable option, large I/O speed demands due to the sizes of individual frames makes latency during visualization a possible issue. Additionally, this mapping still does not solve the issue of huge disk space consumption.</p>\n<p>As such, to facilitate speedy visualization of the raw / completely processed images as well as intermediate stage images (which you may not need to keep the uncompressed pixel values for anyway), it makes sense to lossily compress the images for non-computional, solely visualization purposes. JPkl handles this need by compressing all the individual image slices into JPEGs in memory which can then be serialized out to disk. Depending on image content and JPEG quality level, you can see massive (5-10x +) decreases in file size. In addition, JPkl supports on-the-fly decoding of abitrary slices of the pseudo-NumPy array into true NumPy arrays, meaning when you unpickle the JPkl file, your memory consumption remains as low as the file usage on disk unless you want to convert the whole JPkl into an array at once.</p>\n<p>Note that JPkl is not limited to using Pickle serialization or JPEG encoding. Extending the <code>JPkl</code> class and changing the implementations of <code>jpkl_obj.save()</code> / <code>JPkl.load()</code> or <code>jpkl_obj.encode_slice()</code> / <code>jpkl_obj.decode_slice()</code> will allow you to use any serialization or encoding you wish as appropriate for your application, respectively.</p>\n<p>JPkl is most useful in the case where you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large raw image datasets which you would like to visualize (such as in a Jupyter Notebook)</li>\n<li>Datasets that are highly multi-dimensional (x,y spatial + arbitrary number of time / channel axes)</li>\n<li>The need to visualize intermediate steps of image processing (which adds a multiplier on disk space consumption if\nintermediate steps are stored as raw images)</li>\n<li>The desire to keep all images from a dataset / NumPy array in a single file, rather than all messily dumped as separate .jpgs into the filesystem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JPkl uses the Pillow (PIL fork) library for encoding / decoding JPEG images.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attribution\">Attribution</h2>\n<p>This is part of the Open Source at Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) initiative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://opensource.nibr.com/\">Open Source @ NIBR home</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Novartis/\">GitHub organization</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.</p>\n<p>Maintainer: @zbarry</p>\n<h2 id=\"jpkl-class-file-format-specification-\">JPkl class / file format specification:</h2>\n<p>JPkls on disk are simply a dictionary of:</p>\n<pre><code>&#39;header&#39;: Tuple of (&#39;JPkl&#39;, &#39;version&#39;), version in set{&#39;1&#39;}\n    Used for sanity checking if file on disk is JPkl file and is a loadable version.\n\n&#39;color&#39;: bool: if True, this came from a set of images with a color channel.\n    Therefore, the third axis [index 2] of the returned stack will be of length 3 for RGB.\n    Otherwise, there is no color axis.\n\n&#39;jpeg_quality&#39;: int: level of JPEG compression (0-100).\n\n&#39;images&#39;: Dictionary of byte streams from Pillow `Image` objects encoding images to `bytes` using `io.BytesIO` memory streams\n    Each key of the dictionary is a tuple of (channel 1, channel 2, ...) indices which correspond to a single image\n    slice.

If interested, please post an issue for what you&#39;re thinking about working on so I can make sure it aligns with the vision for the project. The current guiding principle here is to keep it as lightweight / minimalistic as possible, though this is by no means set in stone.</p>\n<p>Areas of immediate interest for PRs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiprocessing for encoding / decoding (chunks of / whole) huge NumPy arrays quickly. Initial array encoding isn&#39;t incredibly fast, though random access for visualization is very usable. Multiprocessing might be a huge boon for the initial construction of the JPkls from arrays.</li>\n<li>Clever ways of caching frequently-accessed images might be useful in some cases.</li>\n<li>Other encoding / compression methods which may be superior to JPEG / Pickle files.</li>\n</ul>\n"}
