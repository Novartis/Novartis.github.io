summary: a package for rapid quantitation and quality control of large scale mRNA-seq datasets
description: |
  PISCES eases processing of large mRNA-seq experiments by encouraging capture of metadata using sim- ple textual file formats, processing samples on either a single machine or in parallel on a high performance computing cluster (HPC), validating sample identity using genetic fingerprinting, and summarizing all outputs in analysis-ready data matrices.
